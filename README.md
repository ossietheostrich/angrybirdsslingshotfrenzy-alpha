**Angry Birds Slingshot Frenzy** is a playable fangame made by OssieTheOstrich; Set to be a "tribute to the franchise and its fan content," the game is based on the traditional Angry Birds formula but with some elements from other games in the series and other fan-made content.

This version (3.0.5) is now considered outdated, and a newer engine is being worked on for more accurate physics and other features.
